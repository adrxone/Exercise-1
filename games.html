<h1>My Top 5 Games Ever:</h1>
<h2>1. Dark Souls</h2>
<p>Great gameplay, great difficulty, free to go wherever, can see almost everything near the start.</p>
<h2>2. Nier Automata</h2>
<p>Great story, good and unique gameplay, great characters, and great music. Is the main inspiration for me wanting to make games.</p>
<h2>3. Destiny 2: Forsaken</h2>
<p>Specific time period of Destiny 2. Large amount of content, hidden content, great gameplay, solid story, also when I was one of the best players in the world for PVP.</p>
<h2>4. Elden Ring</h2>
<p>Great gameplay, first soulslike open world, decent difficulty.</p>
<h2>5. Terraria</h2>
<p>Can be relaxing, can be stressful, nice progression system, nice building system, good gameplay. Is not 2D Minecraft.</p>
