<h1>Introduction:</h1>

<p> Hello, my name is Andrew Delos Reyes.<br>
    I'm a Computer Science major attending CSUF, and it is my last semester here.<br>
    I've been playing video games since I was five years old and still play them to this day.<br>
    I like video games so much I've been practicing making my own games for about 2 years now.<br>
    I hope to make a fully fleshed out high quality game that I can release on Steam as a way of giving back to the community.
